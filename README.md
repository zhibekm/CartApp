# CartApp

Our app has the most user-friendly design, which makes our app competitive, this app is just the beginning of a large online store, but it works great for attracting initial customers.

•	List of products, Main menu, Cart and ability to delete or add any products.

*Сode explaining*

-Thanks to The Extensible Markup Language  we build our front-end part and We use the @BindView annotation to tell us which view we want. Then Model provides data and reacts to controller commands by changing its state, after we create a common boundary across which information is transmitted.

-GridLayoutManager: arranges elements as a grid with columns and rows. The RecyclerView element is designed to optimize work with lists and greatly improves performance compared to the standard ListView

-We use Snapshot to make sure that the sources will be finalized within this version. Next, we write Snackbar, which is provides a button as an option to perform an action. Adapters make it easy to link data to the control

Let's take a look to our app.

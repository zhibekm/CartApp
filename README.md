# CartApp

At the moment, there are not many online stores in our country, our application is an online store for your favorite drinks and sna—Åks.
Our app has the most user-friendly design. 

About App
-My application contains main Menu, Cart part and storage that connected to online database Firebase.
What contains this app? 
-List of products, Main menu, Cart and ability to delete or add any products.

-Thanks to The Extensible Markup Language  we build our front-end part and We use the @BindView annotation to tell us which view we want. Then Model provides data and reacts to controller commands by changing its state, after we create a common boundary across which information is transmitted.

-GridLayoutManager: arranges elements as a grid with columns and rows. The RecyclerView element is designed to optimize work with lists and greatly improves performance compared to the standard ListView

-We use Snapshot to make sure that the sources will be finalized within this version. Next, we write Snackbar, which is provides a button as an option to perform an action. Adapters make it easy to link data to the control
